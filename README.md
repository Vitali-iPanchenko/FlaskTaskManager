# FlaskTaskManager

This is a test project, used to get acquainted with Flask and MongoDB. To make project more 'SOLID-correct', Blueprints were used as an instrument of encapsulation,
to separate main 'app.py' file from unnecessary code blocks. Also all database-connected operations are separated into 'operations.py' file. All blueprints and .html
files were put in different folders to give project adequate structure.
